export const PAYMENT_METHODS = ['Cash', 'ABA Bank', 'ACLEDA Bank', 'Wing', 'Your Bank', 'Other'] as const;
```

```

And update the color mapping in `getCategoryColor()`:
```typescript
const colors: Record<string, string> = {
  Family: 'bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-500 to-purple-600',
  Friend: 'bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-blue-600',
  Business: 'bg-gradient-to-r from-orange-500 to-orange-600', // New

## 📊 **Statistics Tracking**

The dashboard automatically calculates:
- Total contributions in USD
- Total contributions in KHR

## 🎯 **Best Practices**

1. **Always use the confirmation dialog** before deleting guests
2. **Use categories consistently** to make filtering effective
3. **Add notes** for special circumstances or reminders
4. **Keep the exchange rate updated** for accurate totals
5. **Use location field** to organize guests by table/area

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **Guests not loading?**
- Check your Firebase configuration in `firebase.ts`
- Ensure Firestore rules allow read/write to `guestPayments` collection
- Check browser console for errors

### **Can't add guests?**
- Ensure all required fields (marked with *) are filled
- Check that amount is a valid number
- Verify Firebase write permissions

### **Totals not calculating correctly?**

- Check that amounts are being saved as numbers, not strings
